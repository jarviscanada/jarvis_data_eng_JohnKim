# Core Java - Grep Application

# Introduction
The Java Grep App is a command-line tool that mimics the grep command. It searches for regex patterns in text files within a specified directory and its subdirectories, outputting matched lines to a file. Developed in Java, it leverages core Java libraries for file I/O, regex matching, and logging with SLF4J. The app uses Stream APIs for memory efficiency and is built with Maven, packaged with Docker, and uploaded to Docker Hub for ease of use.
