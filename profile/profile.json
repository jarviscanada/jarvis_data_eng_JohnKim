Leveraged OpenAIâ€™s DALL-E 3 AI model to generate images from textual descriptions found within HTML comments and utilized BeautifulSoup in Python to parse HTML files, identify custom comments for image generation, and replace them with img tags. Finally, packaged the Bash and Python scripts within a Docker Container to ensure consistency and reliability across different execution environments.",

These environments addressed issues like infinite forking in student code, which had previously crashed the school's SSH servers typically around due dates. Produced detailed video documentation to guide students in setting up local containers via Docker Hub and connecting to their Azure-hosted environments. This solution also simplified system administration and significantly improved course infrastructure stability.",

The Linux Cluster Monitoring agent can be used for a single machine but optimally would be hosted on multiple Linux nodes in a cluster. Each node would collect hardware and usage data via Bash scripts scheduled by a cronjob, storing the information in a shared PostgreSQL database hosted in a Docker container. The primary users of this tool are system administrators, DevOps engineers, and other IT professionals responsible for ensuring the efficiency of their server infrastructure.",

Developed in Java, it leverages JDBC for database interactions with PostgreSQL, OkHttp for HTTP requests to fetch stock data from the Alpha Vantage API, and SLF4J for logging. The app follows the DAO design pattern for data access and is built with Maven. It is packaged with Docker and can be easily deployed using Docker Compose, ensuring a consistent execution environment.",

It searches for regex patterns in text files within a specified directory and its subdirectories, outputting matched lines to a file. Developed in Java, it leverages core Java libraries for file I/O, regex matching, and logging with SLF4J. The app uses Stream APIs for memory efficiency and is built with Maven, packaged with Docker, and uploaded to Docker Hub for ease of use."
